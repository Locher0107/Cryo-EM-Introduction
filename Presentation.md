# Cryo-EM Introduction

Since 2017, Cryo-EM innovators win the Nobel prize in Chemistry, Cryo-EM has entered the public's eyes. Actually from 2012, Cryo-EM area is rapidly growing due to the improvement of equipments, computation tools for image processing and acquisition of better quality data. Several near-atomic resolution reconstructions of protein structures are obtained, which are amazing. More and more scientists turn their interest into this area including those who try to apply statistical models. For instance, Sjors has developed RELION software which turn the recontruction problem into the optimization of a single target function by bayesian approach and EM algorithm. Punjani A, et al have developed stochastic gradient descent method on this optimization problem which is implemented in cryoSPARC software. Both show good performance of algorithm speed, high resolution and accuracy of calculating the 3D structures.

To introduce the background, we start with the typical procedure of Cryo-EM imaging setup. Many randomly oriented macro-molecules specimen of the same kind are frozen ice and put on a holely carbon film (Fig.1). This carbon film is placed under the electron microscope. When electrons at the speed of light pass through the sample, electrons would be recorded onto a CCD( Charge-coupled device) to form a projection image (Fig.2). More details of this step can be refered to this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq8DO-4BnIY&t=19s.
