Since 2017, Cryo-EM innovators win the Nobel prize in Chemistry, Cryo-EM has entered the public's eyes. Actually from 2012, Cryo-EM area is rapidly growing due to the improvement of equipments, computation tools for image processing and acquisition of better quality data. Several near-atomic resolution reconstructions of protein structures are obtained, which is amazing. More and more scientists turn their interest into this area including statisticians. For instance, Sjors has developed RELION
